Many people focus on the skillsets they need to learn and all the information they need to consume. Rarely do people stop to think twice about how to learn effectively so that every minute spent learning any course material yields maximum retention and the time effort is minimized.

This section is inspired by Barbara Oakley's book Learning How to Learn.

### Lesson's from the book
