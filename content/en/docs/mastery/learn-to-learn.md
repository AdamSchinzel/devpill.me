Many people focus on the skillsets they need to learn and all the information they need to consume. Rarely do people stop to think twice about how to learn effectively so that every minute spent learning any course material yields maximum retention and the time effort is minimized.

This section is inspired by Barbara Oakley's book Learning How to Learn.

### Lesson's from the book

These notes are extracted from [this summary](https://www.allencheng.com/learning-how-to-learn-book-summary-barbara-oakley-terrence-sejnowski-et-al/) of the book. I strongly recommend [reading the book](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-How-Learn-Spending-Studying/dp/0143132547) or taking [Barbara Oakley's Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn).

1. When You Find Yourself Struggling To Solve A Problem Or Learn Anything New, Try To Relax For A Few Minutes. And Then Try Again Later.
2. Procrastination gives you instant pleasure, but it hurts you long-term and makes you highly unproductive.
3. Think in metaphors to learn faster.
4. Learning has no age. Even adults in their 40s or 50s can learn new stuff!
5. Sleeping is important for your brain connections to become stronger and sturdier.
6. Use memory palaces to remember cold hard facts
7. Excercise is good not only for your body but also for your brain
8. Neurons are sophisticated tiny computers in your brain
9. Focus on different aspects while studying a new subject

#### Roam Research

[Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) is a notetaking app that leverages the structure of graphs to synthesize and connect different notes and pieces of knowledge by referencing concepts across notes. You can link different ideas in both directions and create mind maps for anything you learn.

![roam research](https://lawsonblake.com/content/images/2020/08/Roam_Page-2.JPG)

Roam research is a subscription-based paid application ( `$` '15 per month or `$` 165 per year). You can also apply for a scholarship to use Roam for free if you are a researcher, under 22, or experiencing financial distress ([link to apply](https://roamresearch.typeform.com/to/Y8ggm3gR?typeform-source=roamresearch.com)).

It is a great way to create a structure for any learning material, whether it is about Solidity, MEV, DeFi, some protocol design, public goods, or anything else. It is a great way to reference concepts and check where else you have referenced them, and expand on each note you take.

#### Inkdrop

![Inkdrop](https://beta.docs.inkdrop.app/og-cover-image.jpg)

[Inkdrop](https://www.inkdrop.app/) is a Markdown notetaking application that is highly extensible and focuses on developers. I use it to write all of my articles and the [devpill.me](https://devpill.me/) guide and my [article on L2s](https://dcbuilder.mirror.xyz/QX_ELJBQBm1Iq45ktPsz8pWLZN1C52DmEtH09boZuo0), and some other pieces.

I use the Vim extension for writing using [Vim keybindings](https://github.com/vim/vim); I also use the LaTeX extension to occasionally write math equations and some other plugins for modifying how the application looks.

There is a 30-day free trial for the application. Otherwise, it costs `$` 50 per year or `$`6  per month.
